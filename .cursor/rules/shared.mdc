# AI Rules for AI Running Training Planner

## Project Description

AI Running Training Planner is a web application that generates personalized running training suggestions using AI. The MVP focuses on helping beginner and intermediate runners plan their workouts without requiring specialized knowledge.

### Core Features:
- **User Onboarding**: New users add their last 3 training sessions to provide AI with initial data
- **AI Training Generation**: AI generates structured workout suggestions (warm-up, main part, cool-down) based on user's history and feedback
- **Training Management**: Users can manually add, edit, and delete completed workouts (distance, duration, average heart rate)
- **Calendar Visualization**: Main screen displays training schedule with color-coded workout types
- **Rating System**: Users rate completed workouts (too easy, just right, too hard) to improve AI suggestions
- **Progressive Training Logic**: AI adjusts intensity based on last 3 ratings for each workout type (calibration mode for first 3 sessions)

### Out of Scope for MVP:
- File imports (.FIT, .GPX)
- Third-party integrations (Strava, Garmin)
- Charts and advanced data visualizations
- Social features
- Mobile applications

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind 4
- Shadcn/ui

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./src` - source code
- `./src/layouts` - Astro layouts
- `./src/pages` - Astro pages
- `./src/pages/api` - API endpoints
- `./src/middleware/index.ts` - Astro middleware
- `./src/db` - Supabase clients and types
- `./src/types.ts` - Shared types for backend and frontend (Entities, DTOs)
- `./src/components` - Client-side components written in Astro (static) and React (dynamic)
- `./src/components/ui` - Client-side components from Shadcn/ui
- `./src/lib` - Services and helpers 
- `./src/assets` - static internal assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
